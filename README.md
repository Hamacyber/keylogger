# keylogger

A simple keylogger built with Python using the pynput library to capture and log keystrokes.

🚀 Features

    Captures all keystrokes and saves them to a log file (keyfile.txt).
    Logs special keys (e.g., [Shift], [Enter]).
    Runs silently in the background.
    Lightweight and easy to use
